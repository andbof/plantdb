WHERE TO GET THE SOFTWARE

  The official repository is at github:

  https://github.com/andbof/plantdb

PREREQUISITES

  You will need:

  - Django
  - Python
  - Python Imaging Library (PIL)
  - python-crypto
  - python-reportlab

BASIC INSTALLATION

  Unfortunately, django needs to create some files in the repo. Django will
  refuse if the directory name already exists, and so will git. This means
  you'll have to clone first, create a project, and then merge them.

  Clone the plantdb git repository somewhere:

  git clone git://github.com/andbof/plantdb plantdb-repo

  Then start a Django project called plantdb:

  django-admin.py startproject plantdb

  And move everything from the cloned repo into the Django project:

  cd plantdb-repo
  find . -type f -exec mv '{}' ../plantdb/ \;
  cd ..
  rmdir plantdb-repo

CONFIGURING

  The subdirectory "local" will be ignored by git. This is preferrably used to
  store all local stuff, such as the SQL database if you're using sqlite, and
  other files such as uploaded images.

  Set up an SQL database somewhere. Django supports sqlite, which is probably
  the easiest and quickest way.

  Edit plantdb/plantdb/settings.py according to your own system. There's a few
  settings that are plantdb-specific in there, such as what Django apps are
  part of the plantdb site. They are listed in plantdb/plantdb/settings.sample.
  Copy those into your settings.py.

  Now initialize the database:

  ./manage.py syncdb

  Unfortunately, you also need to edit qr/functions.py and change "YOUR_DOMAIN"
  to your domain name. This needs to be fixed somehow in the future.

RUNNING A SERVER

  For testing purposes ONLY, you can use Djangos built-in test server:

  ./manage.py runserver

  For production servers, configure your favourite HTTP daemon. If you're
  running Django via fastcgi, make sure you include this in your HTTP daemon
  configuration:

  - It should handle requests to /plantdb.fcgi

  - Urls beginning with /static/ should be rewritten to drop the "static/" prefix

  - All other urls should be prepended with "plantdb.fcgi"

  See the Django documentation for details.

PlantDB is a plant database for keeping track of all your home-grown stuff
using the python web framework Django.

Fancy features include family trees, data storage with photos and documents, as
well as a QR tag system.

The QR codes contain URLs that can be associated to plants and seeds. They are
generated to a PDF and printed (preferrably printed on stickers) in advance,
and associated with a plant or seed whenever it is planted or harvested,
respectively. They can of course also be associated with store-bought plants
and seeds.

This allows for easy and quick lookup with any smart mobile phone with a QR
reader app, while still being easy to use and as non-instrusive as possible
while planting, when you want to keep your dirty hands far away from keyboards
and touchscreens.

Supported QR sticker sheets are currently A4s with 70x37 mm stickers.

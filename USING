This is my preferred way of working with PlantDB.

Every now and then, I go to https://plantdb.domain/generate_qr and print a new
set of QR codes on stickers.

After I have planted a new plant, I bring forth my trusted smartphone and fire
up my favourite QR app. I read the QR on the seed bag, then read the new blank
QR code. A new plant has now been created and the QR code associated with it. I
affix the QR sticker to a standard plastic plant name stick.

However, sometimes you need to add plants or seeds manually, such as when you
buy them from somewhere else. I use the standard django admin interface for
those occations.

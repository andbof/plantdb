I'm very happy to receive contributions to PlantDB! Don't be afraid to send in
patches.

For coding style, indent with four spaces and follow the standard Python style
at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

For HTML style, look at the existing files. These are general dos and don'ts
for HTML:

- do indent with four spaces
- be generous with line breaks
- do try to keep things within 80 columns
- don't break single long lines just because of what I just wrote
- do validate as XHTML 1.1 using http://validator.w3.org/

For JavaScript, I don't really care except try to keep the JavaScript part of
the project small. The web site must work on terminals that don't support it.
Flashy extended functionality not required for basic operations is fine if it
needs to be in JavaScript, though.

Try to keep each commit small and easy to look through and understand.

All code you contribute must be licensed according to the LICENSE file. You
may, of course, only contribute code that you have written yourself or
otherwise have rights to pass on as an open source patch as per the terms in
the LICENSE file.

Your commits must be done using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or
anonymous contributions).

To actually get your code in, either send me a mail at andreas@gazonk.org with
your patch or create a pull request in github. Either works fine. If you're
unsure on something, just drop me a mail. Most of the times I'll be happy to
answer.

Happy hacking!
